jblas-ruby 1.0 (possible one day)
(c) 2009, 2010 by Mikio L. Braun

jblas-ruby is a wrapper for JRuby of jblas (http://jblas.org), a linear algebra
library for Java.

You need to get jblas.jar for your platform to use jblas-ruby. See http://jblas.org

jblas-ruby is currently in pretty ALPHA stage, although I already use
it for my stuff, meaning that documentation is almost non-existent,
method names are likely to change, and it might not work out of the
box ;)
