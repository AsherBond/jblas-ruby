  # Mixin for all kinds of element access.
  #
  # This mixin is collected into MatrixMixin.
  #
  # You have the following options of accessing elements:
  #
  # * <b>Linear access</b>: accessing all elements linearly, going down rows
  #   first (x[i], x.get(i), x.put(i))
  # * <b>Two-dimensional access</b>: Accessing element in row i,
  #   column j (x[i,j], x.get(i,j), x.put(i,j)
  # * <b>Accessing rows and columns</b>: get_row(i), get_column(i), put_row(i), put_column(i), and
  #   also get_rows(i), get_columns(i).
  # * <b>Accessing row and column ranges</b>: get_row_range, get_column_range, get_range
  #
  # As indices, you can use one of the following:
  #
  # * <b>Numbers</b>: x[10], x[3,4], x.getRow(3), etc.
  # * <b>Indices as int[] arrays</b>: Unfortunately, these are bit hard
  #   to construct in JRuby ([1,2,3].to_java :int), therefore the emthod
  #   to_indices is added to Numeric, Enumerable, Array, and the matrices.
  #   Then: `i = [1,2,3]; x[i.to_indices]`.
  # * <b>Matrices</b>: In that case, x.find_indices is called to find the
  #   non-zero elements and use those as indices.
  # * <b>Ranges</b>: See JBLAS::Ranges
  #
  # For some access functions (in particular getting rows and columns), you
  # can also specify where to copy the result to get better performance through
  # suppressing object creations.
