module JBLAS
  # Mixin for syntactic sugar for arithmetic operations.

  # Collected in MatrixMixin.
  #
  # Roughly defines the following types of operators:
  # * arithmetic (+,-,*,/,...)
  # * logical operations (|,&,...)
  # * logical tests (==,>,<,...)
  # * arithmetic operations with column and row vectors (add_column_vector, ...)
